	<body><![CDATA[<p>In 2004, John and Betsy Smith, newlyweds and recent college graduates from the Culinary Institute of America, formed Restaurant Supplies Unlimited and have since succeeded in creating and fostering an innovative, easy-to-use website to meet the purchasing needs of food service professionals internationally. Developers, programmers, content writers, technical support staff, purchasers, and warehouse employees work together to ensure we provide the best in price, service, and industry knowledge to our customers. <br/><br/>
Based in Lancaster, PA, we are the leading restaurant supply store providing restaurant supplies and equipment to the food service industry and individual customers worldwide. With more than 4 million orders shipped, our large stocked inventory and fast shipping make us the best choice to fill your needs.</p>

		
	<p><b>Fastest Shipping Times</b><br/>We know you want your products delivered in perfect condition as fast as possible, so we invest in distribution in an effort to be the fastest, most reliable shipper in the industry. To ensure that your order goes out as soon as possible, we combine vast warehouse space with an auto conveyor system to operate both efficiently and effectively.</p>


	<p><b>Lowest Prices on the Web</b><br/>We are proud to have low prices and a huge inventory! Our site has over 110,000 products for you to choose from, and we're adding more every day. Thanks to this large volume of inventory, we are able to offer you the lowest prices on the Internet. Now you can stock your entire food service establishment without sacrificing quality for price!</p>

	<p><b>Best Content</b><br/>Did you know that we are the only online restaurant supplier that writes descriptions for each and every product from scratch? Many suppliers don't offer product descriptions at all or describe their products with what they can pull from the manufacturers' marketing material and spec sheets. Restaurant Supplies Unlimited gives you quick easy access to the information you need in a clear and concise fashion!</p>

	<p><b>Customer Support</b><br/>Our friendly, knowledgeable Customer Solutions Specialists are here to help! Whether you choose to contact us via chat or by e-mail, you will be communicating with a real person whose top priority is to assist you. Contact us for a quick, simple solution to any of your commercial kitchen needs!</p>
