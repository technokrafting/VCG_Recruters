	<body><![CDATA[<p><b>Xavier Bardem</b><br/>Purchasing, IT & Web Technologies</p>
		<p>Xavier and the Smiths had been life-long friends, but while John had been working over a hot stove, Xavier found technology fascinating and he had been brought up in the 1990s with a keyboard on his lap.</p>
		
		<p>Starting as a programmer in his younger days, Xavier had been involved with several Silicon Valley start-ups, before teaming up with the Smiths to found Restaurant Supplies Unlimited. Xavier's IT and web skills are instrumental to the success of the company.</p>
		
		<p>Xavier can be characterized as a logical analyst.  Similar to Steve Jobs, his interest is to "tinker" with systems to improve them.  He tends to be "matter of fact" in his approach and has little patience for those that are sentimental or not firmly rooted in logic.</p>
