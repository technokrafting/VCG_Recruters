	<body><![CDATA[<p><b>Raf Alfandri</b><br/>VP, Operations</p>

		<p>Known to be a stickler for rules, Raf is an exceptional executor. In his role as VP of Operations, Raf runs Adams Supply & Services factories like precision machines. <br/><br/>
He is responsible for day-to-day operations, managing the organization's HR, helping and creating organizational and program budgets in collaboration with the Director Sales and Director Strategy. <br/><br/>
Reporting to the Director Strategy, and serving as a member of the Management Team Raf's primary responsibility is ensuring organizational effectiveness by providing leadership for the organizations financial and operations functions.
</p><p>
Raf has recently discovered running and is spending his early mornings enjoying this sport. 

</p><p>
Raf operates with the stance that because he is the VP of Operations, he should take all of the credit. He is overbearing, controlling, and arrogant. He takes pride in knowing that he made someone in the organization angry on a daily basis. However, Raf also gets the job done and has a can-do attitude. 

</p><p>
His biggest gripe is that he believes that the though the Parson "kids" might have started in the business from the bottom they did not earn their way to their current positions. He sees the Parson kids as 'privileged' and does not place any value on their contributions to the business.
