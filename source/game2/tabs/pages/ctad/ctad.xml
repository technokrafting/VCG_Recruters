						<span class="bold">Chef’s Table Accounting Department</span><br/><br/>
						The accounting department has three full-time employees: The CFO approves all invoices and manually signs all checks. The CFO also prepares the financial statements and negotiates banking arrangements. 
						<br/>
						<br/>

						The Sr. Accountant reconciles the bank statement, which is then approved by the CFO. The Sr. Accountant is responsible for accounts receivable, depositing monies as received, and making adjustments as appropriate based on payments made by customers. 

						<br/>
						<br/>

						The Jr. Accountant records accounts payable invoices in the accounting system, adding new vendors as necessary, then preparing the checks for the CFO’s signature.
