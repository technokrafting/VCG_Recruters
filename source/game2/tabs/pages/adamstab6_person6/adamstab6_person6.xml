	<body><![CDATA[<p><b>Felicity Parson Nicodemus</b><br/>VP, Marketing</p>

		<p>
Felicity reports to the CEO and is a member of Adams Supply & Services’ executive team. 
She is also Tanya and Andy’s daughter. 
Felicity joined them full-time in 2004 after finishing her Master’s in Business Administration degree (concentration in Marketing) and quickly began focusing on technology, operations, and marketing.</p><p>

She is responsible for providing executive leadership and management of the marketing organization and in-bound and out-bound marketing activities across the United States.<br/><br/>
Felicity is a free spirit. She is outgoing and charismatic. She relies on her gut instinct rather than the facts. She is a true multi-tasker, always having her headphones playing the latest hip-hop while Facebooking her family and friends, Tweeting clients, viewing the latest YouTube videos on market trends, scanning blogs, while crowdsourcing new business concepts. She is a very strong supporter of her father and feels her mother does not give him enough “space” in which to make decisions. <br/><br/>
On the other hand, she and her brother have never gotten along and can only agree on one thing – mom needs to loosen the reins on the business and let everyone do their jobs.
