	<body><![CDATA[<p><b>Current Situation</b><br/>The market is mature. Their primary customers are local restaurants, community service agencies, and faith-based agencies. Their services include consulting/design, contracts, delivery, distribution, project management, and showroom/product selection. They have a wide array of products from cleaning and janitorial supplies, cooking and preparation equipment, refrigeration, and storage solutions. Due to the enfranchise agreements, they are limited from large chain restaurants that buy from the company.</p>
	
	<p>The company is at a crossroads. They are financially secure, employee retention is high, sales and marketing are stable, and operations are functioning at optimum level. However, growth has stagnated over the past several years due to the maturing and increasingly saturated market. Their IT infrastructure is somewhat antiquated as well as lacking a web presence.</p>
	
	<p>They have considered venturing into the e-commerce market; yet, their IT infrastructure has halted this effort. The company is investigating a new enterprise IT infrastructure, which would be costly and is of uncertain value-add. At this juncture, the CEO wants to prepare for the future. Should they sell, expand further geographically, differentiate, add a product/service line, consider a merger or acquisition, or even opt for a franchise model?</p>
