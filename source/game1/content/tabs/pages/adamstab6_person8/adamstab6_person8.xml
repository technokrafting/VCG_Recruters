	<body><![CDATA[<p><b>Jane Woo</b><br/>General Manager, Logistics</p>

		<p>
Jane has been with Adams Supply & Services from its early days. She has designed the company’s warehousing and logistics and continues to minutely monitor the flow of incoming materials and outgoing finished products. <br/><br/>
She supervises the warehousing managers with an iron hand and oversees warehouse, inventory control, material handling, customer service, transportation, and planning workers. She also negotiates shipping and supplier costs, and works to improve the efficiency of the company’s supply chain.<br/><br/>
Jane is happiest on the golf course and tries to catch a game every evening, though with her tough schedule, she manages it only a couple of times a week. </p><p>

Jane is determined, argumentative, and her need for control has a detrimental effect on employee morale. She is extremely task oriented, disciplined, and focused on structure rather than people.<br/><br/>
Ironically, Jane gets along quite well with Raf, the VP, because they both believe that they know what is right including that nepotism has negatively impacted the firm’s performance.
