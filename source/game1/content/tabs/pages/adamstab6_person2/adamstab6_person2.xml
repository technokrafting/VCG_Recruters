	<body><![CDATA[<p><b>Andy Parson</b><br/>Director, Strategy</p>

		<p>Andy is the former President of Adams Supply & Services. He uses his communication and negotiation skills towards strategy and planning, working closely with general contractors, the Board of Health and other foodservice facility professionals.</p><p>
Andy is also the head of all new projects especially for large facility upgrade and design projects.</p><p>
He is an avid fisherman and cannot wait to get away to the family's log cabin at every opportunity.</p><p>
Andy appears to be very sincere and trustworthy; however, resistant to change. He has difficulty dealing with Type A personalities and does not like things to move quickly. He is very laid back and comes across as calm and competent. He is happy to have others take control but will protect the business from rash changes as if it were his third child.
