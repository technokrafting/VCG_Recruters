		<p>Robin's background with Proctor & Gamble gave her an invaluable grounding in sales and marketing that allows her to creatively promote the varied and exotic foods that Chef's Table provides.</p>
	
	<p>Robin is energetic and personable. She enjoys working with Pia and enacting her vision. She tends to have poor time management skills, as she likes to socialize. This drives Michael crazy when the expense reports are due.</p>]]></body>
