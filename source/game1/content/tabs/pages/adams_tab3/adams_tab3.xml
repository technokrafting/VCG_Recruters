	<body><![CDATA[<p>Restaurant Supply and Service industry - is driven by the growth of the restaurant industry, which is highly tied to economic trends and consumer spending as well as supply and price of labor. Increases in the minimum wage coupled with projected slow growth in the restaurant retail industry is expected to have restaurant equipment sales and suppliers in the near future predominantly providing replacement equipment with a greater focus on maintenance and repair services.</p>
