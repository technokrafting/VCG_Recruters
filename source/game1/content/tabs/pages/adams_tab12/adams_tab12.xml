Demand patterns are closely tied to economic indicators including GDP, discretionary income levels, and unemployment rates. In the past few years, restaurants have been coming out of a price-driven recessionary market where equipment and services were purchased on an “as needed” basis and with slow but steady growth projected, coupled with the need to be more energy efficient and flexible in their operations has led to more discretionary purchasing. </p><p>

<b>Growth Patterns </b><br/>
Different market segments have experienced differing growth patterns with the last 10 years leveling off given declining discretionary income of restaurant consumers coupled with market saturation – the market has shifted from fast growth to very slow growth as the industry has matured. For Adams Supply & Services the growth has come from Mergers and Acquisitions and expansion. In 2004, Adams Supply & Services purchased a mid-sized packaging specialization company called Jaloupe, which was based in Troy, New York. This helped the firm expand its operations to a new area.</p>
