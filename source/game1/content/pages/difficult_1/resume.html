			</span> , transit, and safety planning programs for Genesee Transportation Council (GTC), the Metropolitan Planning Organization serving Rochester and the surrounding nine-county region in Upstate New York. Management of consultant-prepared transportation planning studies, implementation of federally-funded transportation programs, and participation in regional initiatives to advance the mission of the organization -- to maximize the contribution of the transportation system to the social and economic vitality of the Genesee-Finger Lakes Region.<br/>
			GTC functions as a lean organization (a staff of 6-7) focused on its core responsibilities to develop and update the Transportation Improvement Program (TIP), Long Range Transportation Plan (LRTP), and Unified Planning Work Program (UPWP) for the region. This model allows GTC to pass nearly $1,000,000 per year to our member agencies to undertake transportation planning studies to advance the Long Range Plan and inform the GTC TIP development process. These studies comprise about half of the GTC UPWP and my duties include their management from concept development, to procurement, to review and approval of the consultant-prepared studies. GTC carefully follows all federal procurement guidelines to ensure local reimbursement and typically includes the participation of locally selected project steering committees during their development. Over the course of 10 years with GTC, I have managed the completion of more than 30 of these studies, including public transportation strategic plans for many of the rural counties that we serve, safe passing zone surveys and vertical and horizontal curve studies for many of the county highway departments, trail feasibility studies, regional trail plans, and active transportation plans. These studies are paid for initially by the project sponsors (municipalities) and I am responsible to ensure that the consultants get paid.
			My duties also include the implementation of federally-funded transportation programs in the region such as the Safe Routes to School Program (SRTS), the Transportation Enhancements Program (TEP) and the currently-authorized Transportation Alternatives Program (TAP) - working with the New York State Department of Transportation to host applicant workshops provide pre-review of proposals, rate and rank the proposals and develop funding recommendations for the GTC TIP Development Committee, Planning Committee, the GTC Board, and the Governor for.<br/>
			As part of the development and implementation of the TEP, TAP, and SRTS programs I have participated as a member of the statewide MPO Bicycle and Pedestrian, and Safety Working Groups for the last 7 years. These working groups, possibly unique to New York State, bring together federal, state, and metropolitan transportation planners to share ideas, collaborate, and coordinate our efforts in support of transportation planning.<br/>
			I have also helped to implement the FTA-funded Section 5310 Program, the Jobs Access Reverse Commute, and the New Freedom programs for the region. I work with the NYSDOT Headquarters Office in conducting the solicitation, rating and ranking, and developing recommendations for the submitted applications. I have been a member of the state wide Association of MPO's Transit Working Group (which I currently chair) for 7 years and as such have participated in the states development and implementation of these programs as a stakeholder/partner representing the MPO.<br/>
			Regional and statewide initiatives in which I have been involved include the Active Transportation Working Group, which I helped to organize and convene in 2012 leading to the Active Transportation Summits held in Rochester in 2011 and 2013, the CDC-funded Community Transportation Grant administered by Monroe County and the Finger Lakes Health Systems Agency and the Monroe County Livable Communities Initiative.<br/>
			I also led Safe Routes to School efforts for the region; in 2009 I wrote the Safe Routes to School Guidebook for the Genesee-Finger Lakes Region and oversaw Alta Planning + Design's conducting of 10 SRTS Site Assessments for the region. Additional initiatives include the oversight of 10 Community Walkability Action Plans (conducted by a consultant team that I managed).<br/>
			Additional accomplishments include the development of the 2016 Addendum to the region's Coordinated Public Transit-Human Services Transportation Plan (I was the principal author for this plan which guides federal funding for transportation services for the elderly and disabled in the region) and the publication of two editions of the Greater Rochester Area Bicycling Map in 2009 and 2014.<br/>
			My related skills include the use of Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Access, ESRI ArcGIS, Microsoft Power BI, R, etc. I am also an amateur software developer using JavaScript, PHP, and the Google Maps JavaScript API.

			Duties: Managed development of AQMD Budget and led Air Quality Planning Initiatives for the NCUAQMD. Fiscal duties included development of budget and tracking of expenditures and revenues (with the assistance of Debra Harris who is still employed with the AQMD and who you may contact if you wish). Planning duties occupied much of my time and included the operation of the AQMD's small network of Air Quality Monitors (three counties with a population of 130,000 spread over 4,700 square miles. I collected the air quality samples and analyzed them in a laboratory which I maintained to meet California Air Resources Board (CARB) as well as US EPA standards. Worked with the Karuk, Hoopa Valley, and Blue Lake Indian Tribes and the EPA to help them install and operate air quality monitoring equipment on tribal lands. These included High-Volume PM10 Samplers and TEOMS (tapered element oscillating microbalances) monitoring for PM 2.5.<br/>
			With respect to Planning, I developed several program intended to reduce public exposure to mobile source air pollution including heavy duty diesel retrofits (known as the Carl Moyer Program in California) for trucks and fishing boats, and the AB 2766 Program which funded planning efforts such as the City of Arcata's Air Quality Element to its general plan, the Trinity County Telework project, and the publication of the Humboldt County Bicycle Map by the Redwood Community Action Agency.<br/>

My duties also included the general enforcement of federal, state, and local air quality regulations, the inspection of stationary sources of air pollution such as the local particleboard plant and redwood mill, and assisting the state with air quality monitoring during large forest fire events (I've taken samples at over 500 micrograms/cubic meter for PM10 using the high volume samplers).
