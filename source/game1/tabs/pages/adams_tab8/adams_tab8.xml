	<body><![CDATA[<p>Since there are no major players in this industry on the equipment side (and given that this firm has locations in small metropolitan locations) their competition is very similar in terms of resources, services, and customer bases. Their estimated market share for equipment supplies is approximately 20% (of the two locations). However, the services side of the business (especially consulting and design) is far more fragmented and has numerous players who may offer one or several services that this firm offers; market share is hard to calculate and is estimated at 2%.
