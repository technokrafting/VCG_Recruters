	<body><![CDATA[<p><b>Greg Parsons</b><br/>General Manager, Purchasing</p>

		<p>
Greg is Tanya and Andy’s son who started working in the family firm as a high school student. <br/><br/>
He started at the warehouse and worked his way through each job function. Greg knows all aspects of the foodservice distribution industry. </p><p>

He now has a strong, solid background in purchasing and supply chain management, and always takes a proactive approach in reviewing current systems and procedures.<br/>
He does not hesitate to make recommendations and implement changes. 
His key role is in leading Adams Supply & Services forward in securing quality suppliers of materials and components covering price delivery and quality targets.</p><p>

Despite his very serious persona, Greg is a family man at heart, and likes nothing better than spending time at home with his wife and three children. </p><p>

Greg is a know-it-all and believes that since he grew up in the business and worked his way up, he has a better understanding of where the business should grow. He has an entitlement mentality and takes it for granted that he will be the future CEO of the firm. He lacks the big picture focus but does not hesitate to speak his mind. He is also a “tech head” and sees the use of technology as the wave of the future for not only this firm but also the industry in general. He would like nothing more than to be given the freedom to test out some of his “great” ideas but knows that “mom” (Tanya) would not allow it.
