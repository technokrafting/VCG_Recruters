	<body><![CDATA[<p><b>Patrice De LaCroix</b><br/>Sales and Marketing</p>
		<p>Having been in the restaurant business all his life, Patrice brings that Gallic flair to his role and he provides a very experienced and creative element to the marketing for Restaurant Supplies Unlimited.</p>
		
		<p>Patrice is a creative thinker who is quick to find solutions to any problems that arise and has the goal of taking the organization into new and exciting ventures.  He is oriented towards acting rather than planning and analyzing. </p>
		
		<p>His zeal for the new can be problematic if he is confined to the granular details.  He can get caught up in the need to try something new before thinking about the implications to the business. Sometimes, he makes suggestions to customers before advising John and Betsy.</p>
