	<body><![CDATA[<p>The firm started as a family run business with a matriarchal value system but has slowly morphed into a more professionally run business as the son and daughter have taken over more managerial responsibilities. There are still remnants of "family influence" since neither mom or dad has retired and dad is still co-CEO. </p>
	
	<p>This creates a certain amount of tension (as with most family firms) and the children try to balance "love and respect" for their parents with "hard" business decisions (i.e. firing a long-term employee who cannot adapt to changing information technology). </p>
	
	<p>The culture has been fragmented in that the new locations do not include family members and therefore have less allegiance to family values and philosophy.</p>
