The company began with one supply and service location (distributorship) in Massachusetts 25 years ago and has since expanded to 2 locations in the Northeast.

	<p><b>History</b><br/>In 1989, Tanya Parson co-founded Adams Supply & Services with her husband Andy Parson at the small town of Fall Brook, Massachusetts with a goal of providing healthy and delicious supplies to restaurants. She wanted to show that a successful business could also be socially responsible. Tanya chose Yaps her childhood pet to be the brand's own ambassador of quality. Tanya knew that she had value-added services to offer, beginning with exceptional customer service, and could provide her customers with quality products at a reasonable price. For a start, she printed her own address and phone number on every box to encourage customers to contact her if needed. What started as a small mom and pop enterprise has grown in the last 25 years and has now spread to three locations across the U.S. North East.</p>
	
	<p>In 1995, the firm expanded its operations by starting a packaging unit in Corinth, Vermont and then in 2004 started operations in Troy, New York.<br/>
	For all these years of its existence, Adams Supply & Services has provided products and services that are superior to the competition.</p>
	
	<p>Today, Tanya and Andy have divided their responsibilities with Andy being responsible for projects and consulting and Tanya focusing on sales and purchases.</p>]]></body>
