		<p>Stephanie as the Vice President Sales directs the firm’s support investments in sales force effectiveness and manages functions essential to sales force productivity. </p><p>

These include planning, reporting, quota setting and management, sales process optimization, sales training, sales program implementation, sales compensation design and administration, and recruiting and selection of sales force talent.</p><p>

Apart from her official job, Stephanie works at a children’s educational organization, offering her free time doing awareness drives and raising funds. </p><p>

Stephanie is even tempered, organized, and focused on the mission. She is a relationship builder inside and outside the organization. Stephanie has a very professional demeanour and will not get involved in the “personality issues” between Raf and the Parson family. She would like to have more freedom to operate her unit but accepts Tanya’s style of leadership as part of the process and not part of the problem.
