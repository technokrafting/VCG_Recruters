	<body><![CDATA[<p><b>John Smith</b><br/>(Joint CEO) Managing Director, Sales and Marketing, Strategy</p>
		<p>John was the original founder of Restaurant Supplies Unlimited. He was a head chef with experience in some of the best restaurants in Paris, London, and New York.<br/><br/>

His background gave him the insight that he needed to set up Restaurant Supplies Unlimited when late nights and long hours no longer held the same appeal that they had when he was a younger man. John and his wife, Betsy, then saw the opportunity to provide catering supplies and was an early adopter of web technologies, despite being less technically savvy than his friend in business, Xavier.<br/><br/>

John and Betsy are both excellent communicators. Their shared vision is communicated through words and actions. John embraces the strengths of others and challenges his team to think out of the box.
